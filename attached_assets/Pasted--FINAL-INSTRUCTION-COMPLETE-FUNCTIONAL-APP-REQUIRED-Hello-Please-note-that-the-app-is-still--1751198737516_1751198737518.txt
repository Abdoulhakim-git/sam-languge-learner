❗️FINAL INSTRUCTION – COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL APP REQUIRED
Hello,

Please note that the app is still not fully functional, and several core elements are missing or broken. To complete this project properly, I am now requesting a final, full check and correction of every part of the app, with special attention to the following points:

✅ What MUST Be Included and Fully Functional:
🟢 Culture Sharing Section at the End of Each Part

Every part of each module must end with a cultural element that shares something about Niger (tradition, food, village life, clothing, music, etc.)

This must be visible, understandable, and engaging for children

🟢 Practice Link at the End of Each Part

After the cultural content, there must be a clickable link or button that opens a functional practice activity

These links must open correctly and without delay

Must work on both phones and computers, even offline if possible

🟢 Audio Must Work Everywhere

Every part of the app must have complete audio

No audio should be missing, cut off, or overlapping

Voice of Teacher Sam must play clearly, from start to end

Audio should match exactly the text and images on screen

🟢 Written Explanation Must Be on the Screen

Do not rely only on audio — the explanation must also be written clearly on screen

Children must be able to read along with what they hear

🟢 Images Must Match the Explanation

Each lesson or example must include a relevant, child-friendly image

The image must match the vocabulary or concept being explained

No part should have missing or wrong images

🔁 FINAL FUNCTIONAL TEST
Please test the entire app carefully, using this checklist:

 Every module (1 to 10) opens fully

 Every part inside each module opens without error

 All audios play completely

 All explanations are written on screen

 All images appear and match the explanation

 Culture is shared at the end of each part

 Practice links open and work correctly

 App functions on both phones and computers

 App updates automatically for all users, including those who installed before

⚠️ Very Important:
✅ Do not send another version until you have tested EVERY single part manually, and you are 100% sure that the app is working perfectly.

This app is for children. It must be clean, joyful, and functional from beginning to end.

Thank you for your understanding and full collaboration.
