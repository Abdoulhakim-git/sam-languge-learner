### 🔄 8. **END OF PART FLOW (EXAMPLE TEMPLATE)**

At the **end of each PART** in a module, follow this format:

```text
✔️ Great job learning the vowels!  
Now let’s play a game to test your skills.

🔗 Click here to play: [Insert Link or Button]
```

The app should **automatically pause** after the explanation so the child can click.

* **Progress bar** showing child’s journey through the module
* **“Repeat After Me” Mode** where voice pauses for child to repeat
* **Offline Practice Mode** with coloring or matching activities

Would you like me to design a **demo layout or animation script** for one part, like the Alphabet? I can prepare a visual storyboard or generate a sample code snippet for the app builder.
