‚ùóÔ∏èFINAL COMPLETE VERIFICATION REQUEST ‚Äì FULL APP REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE DELIVERY
Hello,

We are now at the final stage of this app, but I must be very clear: there are still too many unfinished or non-functional elements. To avoid going back and forth again, I am asking you to do a full, complete, and deep verification of the entire app before delivering the next version.

üîç What You Must Check and Fix Now ‚Äì STEP BY STEP
Please go through the app manually, and check everything carefully:

‚úÖ 1. Module by Module ‚Äì Part by Part
Open each module (1 to 10)

Inside each module, open each part/lesson one by one

Confirm that the lesson loads fully and correctly

‚úÖ 2. Audio by Audio
Every part must have audio that starts immediately

The audio must be complete, clear, and not cut off

The audio should match the text and visuals

No repeated audio when clicked twice

‚úÖ 3. Image by Image
Each part must display a correct and meaningful image

No missing images

Image must match the lesson content and vocabulary

‚úÖ 4. Explanation and Subtitles
Every part must have the explanation written on the screen

Learners must be able to read and listen at the same time

Subtitles must match the selected language (English, French, or Hausa)

‚úÖ 5. End-of-Part Practice Links
Every part must end with a clickable link or activity

The link must:

Open the correct content

Work on both phone and PC

Load properly without errors

‚úÖ 6. Cultural Sharing & Stories
Keep the culture sharing section at the end of each part

Make sure it's different in each module ‚Äî not the same story repeated

For the cultural story modules, add at least 1 or 2 more new stories

Include local wisdom, short fables, or traditional tales

Make sure each story has audio, subtitles, and vocabulary

‚úÖ 7. Unique Features
Make sure features like:

Language switch

Voice recording

Practice games

Progress saving

Auto-updating for all users
...are tested and working properly

üö® Final Note:
Please do not deliver the next version until you have tested everything above, completely, and manually.
The app must work perfectly from start to finish ‚Äî no broken parts, no missing content, no delay.

We want children to learn with joy and confidence, not frustration. Let‚Äôs finish this project properly.

Thank you.
