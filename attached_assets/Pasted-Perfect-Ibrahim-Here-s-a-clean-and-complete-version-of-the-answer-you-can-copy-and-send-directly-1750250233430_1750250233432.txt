Perfect, Ibrahim! Here's a **clean and complete version of the answer you can copy and send directly to the AI App Builder**. It tells them exactly how to use voice narration **without needing Google Cloud**, based on pre-recorded MP3s using free TTS tools.

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE TO GOOGLE CLOUD TEXT-TO-SPEECH FOR VOICE NARRATION

To avoid using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech and API credentials, we will use **pre-recorded MP3 files** with a **male American voice (Matthew)** generated from a free online tool.

### 🎤 Voice Settings:

* **Voice**: Matthew (American English, male)
* **Tone**: Friendly, warm, joyful (ideal for kids aged 7–17)
* **Speaking Rate**: Slow and clear (adjusted to –2% or –3% speed)
* **Pauses**: Each sentence includes a natural pause of 1–2 seconds.

### 🔊 Audio Format:

* Format: **MP3**
* One file per explanation, word, or concept
* Files are named and organized by module and part (see example below)
