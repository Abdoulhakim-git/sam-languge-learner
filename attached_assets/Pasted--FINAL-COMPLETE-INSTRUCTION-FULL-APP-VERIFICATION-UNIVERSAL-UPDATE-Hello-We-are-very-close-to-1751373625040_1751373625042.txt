✅ FINAL COMPLETE INSTRUCTION – FULL APP VERIFICATION + UNIVERSAL UPDATE
Hello,

We are very close to the final version of the app, but several issues are still affecting the quality of the learning experience. To avoid repeated corrections and ensure the app is truly ready, I am now requesting a complete and careful check of the entire app — step by step, part by part — with every feature working properly.

🔍 PLEASE CHECK & FIX THE FOLLOWING – STEP BY STEP:
✅ 1. MODULES – Open All Lessons One by One
Open every module from 1 to 10

Open each part inside every module

Make sure every lesson opens correctly and fully

✅ 2. AUDIO – Check All Voice Playback
The voice of Teacher Sam must:

Start immediately or with a clear “loading” animation

Play completely, with no cut-off or delay

Match the written text and the image

Never repeat or overlap if clicked twice

✅ 3. IMAGES – Display & Relevance
Every part must include a clear and meaningful image

Images must be correctly linked and not missing

They must match the word or sentence being taught

✅ 4. WRITTEN EXPLANATION & SUBTITLES
The explanation must be written on screen — not only audio

Subtitles must change based on learner choice:

English

French

Hausa

✅ 5. END-OF-PART LINKS – Practice Activities
Every part must end with a working “Click to Practice” link

Links must open the right content

They must work on both phone and PC

Preferably, links should also work offline after first loading

✅ 6. CULTURAL SHARING SECTION
Every part must end with a brief cultural message about Niger

Keep the cultural section visible and different across lessons

In story modules, add at least 1–2 more traditional tales

Each story must include voice, text, subtitles, and images

✅ 7. UNIQUE FEATURES & TECHNICAL STABILITY
Confirm all app features work properly:

Subtitles switching

Voice recording & playback

Practice games

Auto-updating

Offline functionality

🔁 UNIVERSAL UPDATE FOR ALL USERS
Very important: Ensure that the app has a universal update system.

✅ All users — even those who downloaded the first version — must automatically receive the updated version without reinstalling.

📴 OFFLINE FUNCTIONALITY
Please make sure the entire app:

Works even without internet after first installation

Allows learners to complete all lessons, hear audio, and see content offline

📌 FINAL NOTE
Please test the app yourself from beginning to end, on both mobile and computer, before delivering the next version.
Every part must work — no missing explanations, no silent sections, no broken links.

We are building something important for children. Let’s finish strong, and get it right.

Thank you for your efforts and commitment.
