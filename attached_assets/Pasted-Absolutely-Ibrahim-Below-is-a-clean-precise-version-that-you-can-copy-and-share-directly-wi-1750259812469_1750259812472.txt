* Make sure images are **culturally respectful**, natural, and positive.

---

### 📁 FORMAT & DELIVERY:

* Format: **.JPG** or **.PNG**

### ✅ SUMMARY TO IMPLEMENT:

> Apply real Niger/Sahel background images for each module, using photos of villages, classrooms, markets, families, and nature. Use soft visual treatment (blur, overlay) to support readability of on-screen text and subtitles. Deliver images in high resolution, named by module.
