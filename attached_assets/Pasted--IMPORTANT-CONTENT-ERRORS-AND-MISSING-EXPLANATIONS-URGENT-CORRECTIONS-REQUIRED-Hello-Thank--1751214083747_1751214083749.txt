❗️IMPORTANT: CONTENT ERRORS AND MISSING EXPLANATIONS – URGENT CORRECTIONS REQUIRED
Hello,

Thank you for your recent update. I have reviewed the latest version of the app, and while I appreciate the new addition of the culture share section at the end of each part (which is a great improvement), there are still serious errors in the app that must be corrected immediately.

⚠️ Current Problems Observed:
Incorrect Translation Display

Example: When it says “A is for Apple”, the app shows “A est pour pomme” — but this is wrong.

The child sees “A” in English but the object in French only, instead of showing:

A is for Apple
A est pour Apple (or Pomme if subtitle is set to French)
A na nufin Tuffa (if subtitle is Hausa)

✅ The app must display the object name based on the subtitle language selected, not just change the phrase to French.

Missing Explanations in Many Parts

Some parts of modules have no explanation at all — only audio is heard when clicked.

Example: In alphabet or verb parts, only the pronunciation audio works, but there’s no text or explanation shown on screen.

✅ Every part must include:

A short, clear written explanation

Matching audio and image

Proper subtitle display (French or Hausa, based on selection)

Good Progress Noted – Keep This Feature

The culture share section at the end of each part is excellent. Please keep this!

It is well placed and adds value for children to learn more about Nigerien culture.

✅ What Needs to Be Corrected Now:
Fix all translation display errors (English should stay in English, not switch key words into French unless subtitles are set to French)

Restore or add written explanations to all parts that are missing them

Ensure that audio, image, and explanation match in every part

Keep the culture sharing at the end of each part

Make sure all of this works on both PC and phone

🔁 Reminder:
Before the next delivery, please test the app completely and part by part, and confirm that:

All content is correct and aligned with the subtitles

No part is missing audio or explanation

The learner experience is smooth and error-free

Thank you again for your effort — let’s now finalize everything properly for the children.
