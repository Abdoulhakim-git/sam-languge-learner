Absolutely, Ibrahim. Here is a **final, direct, and complete message** you can copy and send to the AI App Builder to request the **full correction of the audio issue across the entire app**. It is clear, firm, and respectful — emphasizing that this is a critical feature and must be resolved properly this time.

## ❗️URGENT FINAL REQUEST: COMPLETE AUDIO ISSUE FIX NEEDED

Hello,

This is a final request to **fully correct the audio system** across the **entire app**. At the moment, **none of the audio features are working properly**. This includes the voice of Teacher Sam, pronunciation examples, and audio instructions in all modules.

---

### 🚨 The Current Problem:

* **No sound is playing anywhere in the app**
* **Teacher Sam’s voice doesn’t speak**
* **Audio buttons and narrations are not responding**
* **The learning experience is broken without sound**

This is affecting **every module** and makes the app unusable for children.

---

### ✅ What You Need to Correct (Completely and Properly):

1. **Fix the global audio function across the app** so that:

   * All voice narration plays smoothly
   * Audio starts automatically when a part is opened (or on tap)
   * Audio files (MP3s or TTS) are properly linked and not missing

2. **Make sure audio works on all common devices**:

   * Android smartphones
   * Tablets
   * Laptops and desktop browsers

3. **Ensure there is always a play/pause button or sound icon** visible to the child.

4. **Test and confirm that the Matthew voice is actually working** in:

   * Alphabet explanations
   * Examples
   * Games and quizzes
   * Practice sessions and stories

5. **Add fallback behavior**: If TTS is used and fails, the system must automatically use pre-recorded audio files.

6. **Avoid autoplay restrictions**: If a browser or phone blocks autoplay, the system should **ask for permission once** and remember it.

---

### 🧪 Test Everything Before Final Delivery:

* Open every module
* Play every part
* Confirm voice plays naturally and in sync with the text and images

---

### 🎯 Final Reminder:

> **Audio is the heart of this app**. Children cannot learn pronunciation, rhythm, or meaning without it. Please treat this fix as a **top priority**, test everything carefully, and confirm back when all sound features are working properly.
