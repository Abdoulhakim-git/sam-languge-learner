# CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

## Issues Found:

1. **Service Worker Conflicts**
   - Multiple service workers (sw.js, sw-offline.js) competing
   - Causes registration failures and app instability

2. **Update Loop Problems**
   - Version checking system still causing continuous loops
   - Server version (2.9.4) != Client version (2.9.5) 

3. **Mixed Rendering Approaches**
   - Server-side HTML modules vs React components conflict
   - Creates confusion about which system to use

4. **Complex Dependencies**
   - React components have many imports that could fail
   - Audio system dependencies may not work offline

## SOLUTION: Create One Unified, Bulletproof System

Need to:
1. Remove ALL update checking mechanisms
2. Use ONE service worker approach  
3. Ensure React components work reliably
4. Fix server/client version mismatch
5. Create truly offline-capable system

## Current Status: NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
Users WILL experience issues with current setup.
